# A2-Rule-Based-System

<p>The goal of this asssignment was to use Lindenmayer Systems to create realisting looking trees using various rules</p>

<p>In the function "create_Tree()" there are 4 parameters the user can change.</p>

<p>In order they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Branch length(length of each branch segment)</li>
<li>Trunk thickness(starting thickness of trunk)</li>
<li>Iterations(overall branch length and complexity)</li>
<li>Density(number of trees drawn on top of each other to add more branches)</li>
</ol>

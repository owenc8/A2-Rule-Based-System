# A2-Rule-Based-System

<p>The goal of this asssignment was to use Lindenmayer Systems to create realisting looking trees using various rules</p>

<p>To run the code you will have to run the cells to install ColabTurtle, and import ColabTurtle.Turtle, IPython.display, clear_output
and random. Then the user will have to run the cell with the main draw, create and setup methods. Finally there is a cell witht he L-system rules and functions that combine previous functions.</p>

<p>Once the user scrolls down there is a function called create_tree(). In the function create_Tree() there are 4 parameters the user can change.</p>

<p>In order they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Branch length(length of each branch segment)</li>
<li>Trunk thickness(starting thickness of trunk)</li>
<li>Iterations(overall branch length and complexity)</li>
<li>Density(number of trees drawn on top of each other to add more branches)</li>
</ol>

<p>The output will be displayed in a window below.</p>
